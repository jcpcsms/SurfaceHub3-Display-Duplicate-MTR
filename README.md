If you are in AV and need to duplicate the Teams room display on a Surfac Hub 3, this one is for you.

Set this up as a scheduled task to run on log on for the Skype account with a 1 minute delay.
You want the task Action to open powershell first, then to run this script in the powershell arguments by calling it.
Make sure you enable the execution policy to allow scripts to run by setting the correct flag as an admin from the admin account in powershell. 
Let me know if you need help.
